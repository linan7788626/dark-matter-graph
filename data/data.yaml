    label: Models
    description: >-
      A "model" is a theoretical framework describing the physical
      mechanism governing the microphysics of dark matter.  Examples:
      warm dark matter, axion dark matter, primordial black hole dark
      matter, etc.
  - key: probes
    label: Probes
    description: >-
      A "probe" is a physical prediction of how a model would produce
      an observable change in the universe that is distinguishable
      from the "standard" cold, collisionless LCDM. Examples: minimum
      subhalo mass, anomalous energy loss mechanism, halo triaxiliaty,
      etc.
  - key: measurements
    label: Measurements
    description: >-
      A "measurement" is a physical observable that can be measured to
      test a probe.  Examples: satellite galaxy luminosity function,
      galaxy-galaxy strong lensing flux anomalies, etc.
  - key: targets
    label: Targets
    description: >-
      A "target" is an astrophysical source or source class which is
      used to make a measurement.  Examples: populations of stars,
      individual galaxy clusters

  - key: nanolens
    label: Stellar nanolensing
  - key: wdlf
    label: White dwarf luminosity function
    description: >-
      Anomalous cooling mechanisms would produce a measureable change
      in the luminosity function of white dwarf stars. LSST will be
      able to detect faint white dwarfs through color cuts and proper
      motions.
  - key: rgb
    label: Red Giant Branch Populations
    description: >-
      Anomalous cooling mechanisms would alter stellar evolution to
      decrease the time that stars spend in the red giant branch
      (RGB). LSST could measure the relative abudances of RGB stars
      and stars in other evolutionary phases in resolved stellar
      systems.
  - key: wide_binary
    label: Population of wide-binary stars
    description: >-
      Wide-binary stars are very loosly bound systems, and hence the
      lifetime and abundance of these systems is sensitive to the
      abundance of massive compact perturbers. Will LSST should be
      able to find candidate wide-binaries through color magnitude
      cuts?
    followup: deep spectroscopy
  - key: cluster_centroid
    label: Cluster centroid offsets
    description: >-
      Colliding clusters offer an opportunity to measure offsets
      between the dark matter and visible centroids. Such offsets
      could result from self-interacting dark matter. LSST will find
      tens of thousands of clusters and could significantly increase
      the statistical. Measurements may be possible with LSST weak
      lensing, but it is likely that devoted optical and X-ray
      followup will be necessary.
    followup: space imaging, x-ray
  - key: cluster_splash
    label: Cluster splashback radius
    description: >- 
      The splashback radius of galaxy clusters is a probe of the halo
      density profile.
  - key: lyman_alpha
    label: High-z quasars
    description: >- 
      By finding z > 2 quasars and close quasar pairs, LSST can help
      test small scale structure of dark matter in the high-redshift
      universe.
    followup: Deep spectroscopy
  - key: local_kinematics
    label: Local stellar kinematics
    description: >-
      LSST proper motions should allow for the measurement of local
      stellar kinematics and the local distribution of dark
      matter. This is an important normalization for direct detection
      dark matter experiments.
  - key: halo_kinematics
    label: Halo stellar kinematics
    description: >-
      LSST will find distant tracers (RR Lyrae, BHB stars, satellite
      clusters/galaxies, etc.) that will probe the Milky Way dark
      matter halo at large radius. This will help constrain the halo
      profile and triaxiality.
    followup: spectroscopy
  - key: sn_lensing
    label: Supernova lensing
    description: >-
      LSST can search for anomalous magnification of supernova via
      gravitational lensing.  This can be used to test microlensing
      from compact dark matter and caustics from fuzzy dark matter .
    followup: spectroscopy
  - key: udgs
    label: Ultra-diffuse galaxies
    description: >-
      Ultra-diffuse galaxies are underluminous for their measured dark
      matter mass. Their formation may stress stellar-mass-halo-mass
      relationships. LSST will greatly increase our sensitivity to
      these galaxies.
