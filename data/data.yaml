# Data entry file.
#
# Model - A "model" is a theoretical framework describing the physical
#   mechanism governing the microphysics of dark matter.  Examples:
#   warm dark matter, axion dark matter, primordial black hole dark
#   matter, etc.
#
# Probe - A "probe" is a physical prediction of how a model would
#   produce an observable change in the universe that is
#   distinguishable from the ""standard"" cold, collisionless
#   LCDM. Examples: minimum subhalo mass, anomalous energy loss
#   mechanism, halo triaxiliaty
#
# Measurement - A "measurement" is a physical observable that can be
#   measured to test a probe.  Examples: satellite galaxy luminosity
#   function, galaxy-galaxy strong lensing flux anamolies, etc.
#
# Target - A "target" is an astrophysical source or source class which
#   is used to make a measurement.  Examples: populations of stars,
#   individual galaxy clusters
